# StepCounterWidget-iOS
The CountSteps SwiftUI application aims to provide users with a convenient way to track their daily step count and sleep duration. It utilizes HealthKit to store and retrieve health-related data. The app allows users to input their sleep hours and step count through an intuitive interface, and these inputs are saved to HealthKit for later reference. The app also fetches and displays the user's current step count and sleep duration using HealthKit data. With its user-friendly design and integration with HealthKit, the "CountSteps" app encourages users to maintain a healthier lifestyle by keeping track of their physical activity and sleep patterns.
